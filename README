Parse::PlainConfig
==================

Author: Arthur Corliss
Date:  Jan. 17, 2002

Description:
------------

This is a public release of a module that I've used and maintained internally
for quite some time.  Because of that, I consider it a stable and mature
module, ready for production use.

Instructions:
-------------

Like all CPAN modules, just enter the following commands:

	$ perl Makefile.PL
	$ make
	$ make test
	$ make install

If you wish to see sample code using the module, please examine test files in
the t directory.  A sample rc file is there as well, which shows the
robustness of the parser.
